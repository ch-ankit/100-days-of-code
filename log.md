# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on State Design patterns and updating mutable data structures(array,objects) through states, worked on dice exercise and add icon.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Fornt end is new for me but I am improving in it.
