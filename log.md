### Day 1: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React State Design patterns and updating mutable data structures(array,objects) through states, worked on dice exercise and add icon.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Fornt end is new for me but I am improving in it.

### Day 2: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on State Design patterns. Built a heads and tails counter and a color box app which used states

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today there was less CSS portion. I did coin flip exercise in the first try and had to take hints for the color box app.

### Day 3: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dived into the world of React Events (fun world to be in). Created a simple event triggred app which changes the color of the whole div according to the color of the button pressed.

**Thoughts:** It was fun learning events, making things dynamic with Event triggered functions. Stumbled with the infamous "this." of JavaScript and found ways to bind it for use in the Event triggred functions.
