# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React State Design patterns and updating mutable data structures(array,objects) through states, worked on dice exercise and add icon.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Fornt end is new for me but I am improving in it.

### Day 2: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on State Design patterns. Built a heads and tails counter and a color box app which used states

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today there was less CSS portion. I did coin flip exercise in the first try and had to take hints for the color box app.

### Day 3: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dived into the world of React Events (fun world to be in). Created a simple event triggred app which changes the color of the whole div according to the color of the button pressed.

**Thoughts:** It was fun learning events, making things dynamic with Event triggered functions. Stumbled with the infamous "this." of JavaScript and found ways to bind it for use in the Event triggred functions.

### Day 4: May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much coding but focused on theory today. Learnt about how child component communicates with parent component. Did a small work on binding "this" and also learnt good and bad practices of binding.

**Thoughts:** The downward data flow in react makes it easier while debugging the code so it was an important lesson today to learn how child can affect the states of parent so that states can be centralized in parent component and downward data flow can be maintained.

### Day 5: May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about the keys given to iterative components in react to identify them uniquely. Similarly, I built a hangman app whose starter code was provided. It was a test exercise and I completed it in first try.

**Thoughts:** My CSS skill is improving and I do not feel pressured also my React skill is improving. I can now figure out what to choose as props and what to keep in states. Similarly, I now know about the naming conventions of method.

### Day 6: May 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made the hagman app more statefull and added some more features making it appealing to the eye. Went through the starter code for Light's out game.

**Thoughts:** Hangman game was not much of a challange but this Light's out game seems tough and needs time. There is lots of designing as well. Need to implement the logic too.

### Day 7: May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Lights out game along with the logics involved and the designing. Started with React Forms.

**Thoughts:** The Lights out exercise has helped me to develop confidence in both React and JS as whole. The designing was overwhelming at first but slowly I'm getting better.
