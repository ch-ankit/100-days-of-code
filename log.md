# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React State Design patterns and updating mutable data structures(array,objects) through states, worked on dice exercise and add icon.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Fornt end is new for me but I am improving in it.

### Day 2: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on State Design patterns. Built a heads and tails counter and a color box app which used states

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today there was less CSS portion. I did coin flip exercise in the first try and had to take hints for the color box app.

### Day 3: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dived into the world of React Events (fun world to be in). Created a simple event triggred app which changes the color of the whole div according to the color of the button pressed.

**Thoughts:** It was fun learning events, making things dynamic with Event triggered functions. Stumbled with the infamous "this." of JavaScript and found ways to bind it for use in the Event triggred functions.

### Day 4: May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much coding but focused on theory today. Learnt about how child component communicates with parent component. Did a small work on binding "this" and also learnt good and bad practices of binding.

**Thoughts:** The downward data flow in react makes it easier while debugging the code so it was an important lesson today to learn how child can affect the states of parent so that states can be centralized in parent component and downward data flow can be maintained.

### Day 5: May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about the keys given to iterative components in react to identify them uniquely. Similarly, I built a hangman app whose starter code was provided. It was a test exercise and I completed it in first try.

**Thoughts:** My CSS skill is improving and I do not feel pressured also my React skill is improving. I can now figure out what to choose as props and what to keep in states. Similarly, I now know about the naming conventions of method.

### Day 6: May 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made the hagman app more statefull and added some more features making it appealing to the eye. Went through the starter code for Light's out game.

**Thoughts:** Hangman game was not much of a challange but this Light's out game seems tough and needs time. There is lots of designing as well. Need to implement the logic too.

### Day 7: May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Lights out game along with the logics involved and the designing. Started with React Forms.

**Thoughts:** The Lights out exercise has helped me to develop confidence in both React and JS as whole. The designing was overwhelming at first but slowly I'm getting better.

### Day 8: May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on React forms today and learned a new propety introduced in ES2015 (computed property name) and also dealt with multiple forms and how one event handler can handle multiple on change properties.

**Thoughts:** Helped in understanding how forms work in React. Each time something is changed in form the state of the component will be updated causing it to re-render which displays the value of current state in the input section. Also learned about the computed property name introduced in ES2015

### Day 9: May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: React forms exercise and learned to use the uuid library. Building a color box app using react forms.

**Thoughts:** Since forms are always stateful in React, there is upward data flow in forms due to which we need to call the function of parent from children form and change the state of the parent.

### Day 10: May 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Todo List app which contained features such as add new todo, edit, delete and completed work.

**Thoughts:** Very beneficial and a lot of thinking involved today and helped in developing confidence to a high. Really looking forward for more.

### Day 11: May 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the todo list app with styling and started with understanding the Yahtzee-app starter code.

**Thoughts:** The todo List app involved a lot of JS and React logic and was a great practice exercise. The Yahtzee app has a lots of nested components into one another and is a bit complex and the starter code took a lot of time to understand.

### Day 12: May 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Yahtzee game app. Added the missing rules, dice animations and on click animations on score table. Added the total scores and disabling the buttons when rolls is finished

**Thoughts:** This application consisted of nested components and the methods needed to be passed two levels below to other components. There was more of JS logic in the application than react. The react part was mostly easy.

### Day 13: May 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some bugs of the Yahtzee game app and studied about the React Lifecycle methods.

**Thoughts:** The React lifecycle methods are very useful for various purposes such as delaying in setting state, resetting the timers, playing with previous values of states and props of a component etc. Mainly used methods are: mounting, updating and unmounting.

### Day 14: May 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made the deck of cards application which uses axios to fetch data from the api and display the cards.

**Thoughts:** Use of React Lifecycle methods was clear in this project and it enhanced my knowledge regarding the different react lifcycles.

### Day 15: May 21th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on Dad's Joke application.

**Thoughts:** There are many cool features in this application which helps to make the app more stateful and dynamic. A great exercise.

### Day 16: May 22th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued the dad's joke app project.

**Thoughts:** Implementing the logics are very fun in this app. There are animations and various new styling features.

### Day 17: May 23th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the dad's joke app.

**Thoughts:** Learnt many new things while doing this project. New styling features were also used. Confidence with states and lifcycle methods has increased.

### Day 18: May 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished React Routers theory.

**Thoughts:** React router is used to achieve client side rendering which is mostly used for a single page application. Learned about different components of react router such as NavLink, Link, Switch etc. and the difference between the component and render props.

### Day 19: May 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a vending machine app as a part of React router exercise

**Thoughts:** Helped to practice React Routers and introduction of children props of a component and how it can style multiple components with a single stylesheet and its other uses.

### Day 20: May 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced with React Router Patters.

**Thoughts:** Learned different methods for routing such as passing single or multiple parameters in the url, including search form, redirect component and the difference between redirect component and history.push while routing.

### Day 21: May 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a dog description app to practice react router exercise.

**Thoughts:** Implemented various route components such as navlink, route, link, redirect etc. Made the app more responsive with css styles.

### Day 22: May 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the dog details app. Styled it today with bootstrap, yesterday only css was used. It's easy and time saving. Looked at COVID tracker project. And finally started with the massive color app project.

**Thoughts:** Got to know about the new techs I'll be using in this new project such as Material UI, JSS and other react helpers. This is going to be a massive project with 80+ video tutorials. Going to be busy with this for couple of days.
