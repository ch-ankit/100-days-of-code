# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React State Design patterns and updating mutable data structures(array,objects) through states, worked on dice exercise and add icon.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Fornt end is new for me but I am improving in it.

### Day 2: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on State Design patterns. Built a heads and tails counter and a color box app which used states

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Today there was less CSS portion. I did coin flip exercise in the first try and had to take hints for the color box app.

### Day 3: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dived into the world of React Events (fun world to be in). Created a simple event triggred app which changes the color of the whole div according to the color of the button pressed.

**Thoughts:** It was fun learning events, making things dynamic with Event triggered functions. Stumbled with the infamous "this." of JavaScript and found ways to bind it for use in the Event triggred functions.

### Day 4: May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much coding but focused on theory today. Learnt about how child component communicates with parent component. Did a small work on binding "this" and also learnt good and bad practices of binding.

**Thoughts:** The downward data flow in react makes it easier while debugging the code so it was an important lesson today to learn how child can affect the states of parent so that states can be centralized in parent component and downward data flow can be maintained.
